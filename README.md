# RegularExpressionParser
This regular expression parser will supply strings that match a certain regex up to a defined max length.  The program will ask for the regex, then the max length.  The operations are as follows in order of precedence.  Note from developer: Program may fail on sufficiently long and complex grammars due to limited memory.
